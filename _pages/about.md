Hey, I am Lan, Jing, an undergraduate student majoring in computer science at Sun Yat-sen University. I am currently a member of [SYSU Student Cluster Competition Team](https://scc.sysu.tech/), and a research intern at the National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou. My advisor is [Prof. Huang, Dan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Bo6PwnQAAAAJ).

Currently, my research interest falls in high-performance computing and distributed systems.

News:

* May 1st. We are working on Chinese Academy of Sciences PRA'21: [Pages](https://cas-pra.sugon.com/). I'm working on:
  *  Migrating and optimizing CP2K on an AMD cluster(with ZEN1 CPUs and Mi50 GPUs).
  *  Code a high-performance, GPU-accelerated eigenpairs solver for large-scale complex hermitian matrices.
* May 4th. Our submission to Student Cluster Competition @ SC21 has been received. 
* July 1st. We won the 4th place & Honorable Mention at SCC @ ISC21! Only 0.3% behind the 3rd place. Big thanks to all the team members! [News](https://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/events/student-cluster-competition/index.php)
