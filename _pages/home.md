Hey, I am Jing Lan (Ching Lan in Wade-Giles), an MPhil student at CSE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. James Cheng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jcheng/).

I obtained my BEng degree from Sun Yat-sen University, where I did RA with [Prof. Dan Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Bo6PwnQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I spent two years (one as leader) on HPC competitions with [SYSU Student Cluster Competition Team](https://scc.sysu.tech/).

## Research Interests

I have a broad interest in building efficient distributed systems. I focus on exploring systems' interaction with the hardware and their application patterns.

At CUHK, my ongoing project is an in-memory, disaggregated graph OLAP engine designed for concurrently handling highly skewed workloads.

## Publications
