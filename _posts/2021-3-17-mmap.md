Memory-mapped IO through Linux **mmap** command is fundamental to many critical techniques in systems programming. For instance, MPI could use mmap to implement fast communication between processes *within a node*. In-memory file systems require mmap and, optimizations are studied to improve IO with the secondary storage. This blog covers some naive concepts on how mmap works.
