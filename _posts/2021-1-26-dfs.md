As the final project of DCS325 Distributed System

Jan. 24th, 2021 ~ Jan. 25th, 2021

## Environment

* Ubuntu 20 on WSL2
* Python 3.8.5
* Google Protobuf and grpc, installed with pip3

## Structure and Workflow

![struct]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/struct.png){: .align-center}

* The lock manager and the metadata server(MDS) are first online.
* Then file servers should register themselves to the MDS, getting their unique IDs.
* File servers send heartbeat to the MDS in every circle(e.g. five seconds), or will be considered offline.
* Clients request list of active servers, then choose one to connect to.

## Features

* Unique IDs for both file servers and clients. Each client holds its own remote working directory.
* Supports shared(read)/exclusive(write) file access.
* Atomicity. Broadcast updates to replicas within a remote operation.
* Simplest isolation. Clients not premitted to see and operate outside the root of servers.

## Usage

* help : output the following messages
* pwd : current remote working directory
* cd : enter a given path
* ls : list files/dirs under pwd
* mkdir : create a remote dir
* rm : remove a remote file. Recursive delete for folders.
* upload : upload local_file as remote_file
* download : download remote_file as local_file
* open : open a remote file, in r(ead)/w(rite) mode
* lso : list opened files
* close : with file id(look up by lso), update changes if in write mode
* clear : clear the screen
* exit : close all files and exit the client
