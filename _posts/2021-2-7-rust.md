## Ownership

Ownership is Rust's solution to memory management.

Recall that how variables(especially located on the heap) are managed by compiled languages like C and interpreted languages such as Python. The C programming language takes nearly no control over the allocation and deallocation of heap memory. Programmers are responsible for doing so correctly, which is hard. Many memory problems related to poor management have been encountered all the time:

* memory leakage due to missing deallocation.
* Freeing the same address twice.
* Dangling pointers referencing to nowhere.
* Shallow copy v.s. deep copy.

The contrary strategy is adopted by languages like Python. Python uses reference counting(not for PyPy) and garbage collector to ensure memory safety. Usually programmers need not to care about the memory space that underlies variables. Here are some descriptions on Python's memory management:

* memory layout: https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/
* garbage collection: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/garbage-collection-python/

Rust, as a compiled language, requires programmers to be more specific on data creation and assignment. As a result, no explicit new/free is needed and many run-time errors can now be detected at compile time.

Variables in Rust are immutable by default: you have to add 'mut' to declare them as mutable. You are also prohibited to create immutable reference to a mutable variable. Then there are two types of variables as for memory location: those that are fully on stack and those have parts on the heap. For the first kind(e.g. most atomic types), variables are still usable after an assignment. This isn't true for the other kind(e.g. strings), due to the moved ownership.

```Rust
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

First, once a variable is created, it claims its ownership to the contained value. Ownership of that value is then transfered once you assign it to another variable. If you want to reuse the variable after an assignment, you can either call .clone() method to conduct a deep copy, or you may want to borrow this ownership by reference. The first kind of data mentioned above, often refered as stack-only data, hold the Copy trait that keeps their ownership after assignment, as brand new values are created then given to the assigned variables. This is the default behavior of Rust because operations on stack is relatively fast. The second type, on the other hand, often holds the Drop trait that will free up the occupied heap space once variables go out of scope.
